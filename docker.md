## VMs vs. (Docker) Containers

A VM centered world, a monolithic VM containing the application code
and the stateful data.
A micro service architecture, many small services (docker containers) each
holding an application.
No backups of containers because they hold no data.
The data lives in a docker volume
Docker containers (otimally) are completely stateless and immutable.
